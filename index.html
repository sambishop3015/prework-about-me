      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a family man with a loving Wife and two beautiful boys. I enjoy the outdoors, adventure, technology, and solving problems.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've lived in a lot of places growing up, but home to me is Anna Maria Island on the West coast of Florida. I was born and raises in that area and that's where most of my friends are located.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Man! How hobbies and interests change when you have a growing family. My favorite pass times are scuba diving and snowboarding. However, at this point in my life I really just enjoy spending quality time with my wife and boys.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is where my interests meet my skills... I'll let you know when I find it!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Right now we live just North of Grand Haven, Michigan. We're also on the hunt for some acreage to build our dream home.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always had a strong interest in computers, the internet, and what makes it all tick. Later in life, I started playing with arduinos and learned very basic code so I could automate processes around the home. Ultimately, I'm a learner and have a goal of working remotely. Web Dev seems to line up with all of that.</p>
